Laser cut components for 1/8" acrylic
The component files are duplicated as svg, pdf, and dxf files for ease of use by whoever is cutting them. Some laser cutters work better with a particular kind of file format. 

1x clear_top - clear acrylic
1x diffuser_top - clear acrylic
1x opaque_top - white acrylic
1x access_door_wall - white acrylic
1x entrance_wall - white acrylic
2x vent_walls - white acrylic
1x wall - white acrylic
1x feeder_base - white acrylic

The entrance wall file and the wall file are interchangeable depending on whether the entrance
Part is being used or not (ie whether the bees are going to be let out of the nest or not). I recommend cutting both so you have both options.

The diffuser_top file has 2 different laser path intensities - one to cut the top out, and one to score it in a checkerboard pattern. Each laser cutter is different, so it is hard to give direct settings. For the scoring paths of the diffuser_top file, we want a cut probably 1/4 - 1/3 of the way through the clear 1/8" acrylic. We want to avoid warping. For those getting these cut commercially, you should let the people know that about this file.


3D printed components

All parts should be printed with a 0.4mm nozzle at 0.15mm layer height and automatic supports.
For each box we need these number of printed components:

1x base_insert.stl
1x base.stl
4x bottom_wall_connector.3mf
1x camera_mount.3mf
1x custom_box_entrance.3mf
3x entrance_inner_door.3mf
1x imaging_top_side_innie.3mf
1x imaging_top_side_outie.3mf
1x latch_key.stl
2x latch.stl
4x box_foot.3mf
3x outer_door.3mf
4x top_wall_connector.3mf
